# 42 Embedded Systems Piscine

## What is this?

A 2-week intensive bootcamp where you learn to program microcontrollers - tiny computers that control everyday electronics like washing machines, coffee makers, or car dashboards. You'll write code in C to make LEDs blink, read sensors, and communicate with other devices, all on a physical electronic board.

**Duration**: 2 weeks  
**Language**: C  
**Hardware**: ATmega328p microcontroller board

## Why is this interesting?

Unlike regular programming where you run code on your computer, here you're controlling physical hardware directly. You'll understand how software meets electronics, from making an LED light up to building complete interactive systems.

## What you'll learn

### Week 1

- **Day 00**: First Programs - Turn LEDs on and off
- **Day 01**: Timers - Precise timing without stopping your program
- **Day 02**: Interruptions - React instantly to external events
- **Day 03**: UART - Send messages between devices
- **Day 04**: Advanced Timers - Control brightness and create effects
- **Rush 00**: Multiplayer - Team challenge

### Week 2

- **Day 05**: Analog - Read real-world sensors (temperature, light, etc.)
- **Day 06**: I2C - Connect multiple smart components
- **Day 07**: EEPROM - Save data permanently
- **Day 08**: SPI - High-speed device communication
- **Day 09**: Expander & 7 Segments - Control many outputs with few pins
- **Rush 01**: Final Boss - Put everything together

## Tools you'll use

- **avr-gcc**: Compiler that translates your C code for the microcontroller
- **avrdude**: Uploads your program to the board
- **screen**: Terminal to see messages from your device
